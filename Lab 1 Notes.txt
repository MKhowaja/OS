write code
download
run from flash
open up terminal and see hello world printed


run same code from simulator (using debugger)

start up and UART_Polling files
pull(poll?) one of the serial ports and write it through the port

serial starts from 1

only use one UART, UART 1

follow steps in ch 8

make RAM target?

relocate code and readonly data to ram
then debug on RAM

UART_IRQ : INVESTIGATE THIS. COM0 interrupt driven, COM1 polled
COM0 eventually becomes OS console
COM1 polled when theres an issue within the interrupt if there is an issue

open up both COM0 and COM1 windows?
putty terminal connectected to two 

SVC used to program system call

Context_Switching contains source code to show how to switch b/w two processes assuming no hardware input
Context_Switching_IRQ more complex: assuming we have external interrupt, and I want to switch between two processes by pressing a key (Don't need for P1)


Timer_irg: timer interrupt handler

Auto_test sample code assumes done P1 then we can use this code to show how to use 3rd party libraries to test your code

in demo, provided with obj code, so we link with our OS (Automated testing)

open device manager and go to Ports to see what the COM ports are connected to (COM1 + two random COM numbers possibly consecutive like COM11 and COM12)
